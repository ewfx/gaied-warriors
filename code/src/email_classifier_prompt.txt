**Objective:**  
Your task is to classify the **Request Type** and **Subrequest Type** strictly based on the predefined categories in the reference image. The classification must be performed using three input documents.  

**Task:**  
You are an expert in document classification. Your goal is to analyze the content of the three provided documents and classify them using the predefined **Request Type** and **Subrequest Type** categories strictly as mentioned below.  

**Instructions:**  
1. Carefully extract relevant details from the provided documents.  
2. Compare the extracted content with the predefined categories.  
3. Determine the **most appropriate Request Type and Subrequest Type**.  
4. If a document does not clearly match any category, choose the closest match and assign a **Confidence Score**.  
5. Ensure that only the **Request Types** and **Subrequest Types** listed below are used. Do not create new categories or deviate from them.  
6. Respond with only the JSON array containing the classifications, without any additional text or headers.
