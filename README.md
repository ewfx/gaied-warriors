## 💡 Inspiration
In today's digital age, professionals spend hours managing their email inbox. We were inspired to create a solution that leverages AI to automate email categorization, reducing the time spent on email management and improving productivity.

## ⚙️ What It Does
- Automatically classifies emails using GPT models
- Provides intelligent categorization based on email content
- Processes emails in real-time
- Delivers accurate classification results
- Explains classification reasoning

## 🛠️ How We Built It
We developed this solution using modern AI technologies:
- GPT models for intelligent email analysis
- FastAPI backend for handling API requests
- Langchain for structuring prompts and processing responses
- Python for backend implementation
- OpenAI's API for accessing GPT models

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
- Optimizing prompt engineering for accurate classifications
